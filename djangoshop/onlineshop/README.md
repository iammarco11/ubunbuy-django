# Environment
I created an environment to work on so that I don't have to install required packages every time I take my project.<br>

```virtualevnv -p /usr/bin/python onlineshop```<br>
```source onlineshop/bin/activate```<br>
**NOTE:** The 'onlineshop' is the name of the environment I used. You can use anything.<br>
