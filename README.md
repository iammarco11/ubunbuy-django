# Ubunbuy
This is a web app made by me using django 2.2.6.

First clone the repo after starring :smirk: :thumbsup:
```git clone https://github.com/iammarco11/ubunbuy-django.git```

After that go to the cloned repo and start a virtual environment :coffee:
```virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 online```
**NOTE** : Here online is the name of the virtual environment.

Then activate the virtual environment :smile:
```source online/bin/activate```

Then install the required packages by typing
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Now you are ready to go :smile:

To launch the site
```python manage.py runserver```
